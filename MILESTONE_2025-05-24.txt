Milestone: 2025-05-24

- UI no longer hangs at startup or during runtime.
- Sound plays reliably on both button and keyboard events.
- Uses mpsc channel for keyboard-to-UI communication.
- Uses futures-timer async delay in the receiver loop for proper async yielding.
- All code compiles and runs as expected.

Key files:
- src/libs/ui.rs (see attached for working version)

If any error occurs in the future, revert to this milestone for a known-good state.
