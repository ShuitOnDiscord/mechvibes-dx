# MechvibesDX

MechvibesDX is an upgraded version of Mechvibes, rewritten from scratch in Rust using Dioxus.

The codebase is now available for inspection and learning purposes. MechvibesDX provides a modern, performant implementation with improved features and stability compared to the original.

You can try it out right now by cloning the repo and building with Dioxus CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes-dx.git
cd mechvibes-dx
dx serve
```
